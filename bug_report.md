**Bug Report**

**Platform:** LiteCode  
**Version:** [Specify Version if known]  
**Date:** October 26, 2leshoot  

---

### **Issue Summary**
Users cannot directly enable Design Mode for individual modules. The toggle button within a 
module's foldout block is initially disabled and unresponsive. To enter Design Mode, users must 
first navigate to the "Manage" section, select "Follow Me," generate a QR code, and then attempt 
to access design mode via an indirect method.

---

### **Steps to Reproduce**
1. Log in to LiteCode.
2. Navigate to any module (e.g., from GitHub custom modules or example modules).
3. Fold out the selected module block by clicking on its header or expansion icon.
4. Attempt to enable Design Mode by toggling the "Design Mode" switch within the foldout 
interface.

**Expected Result:**  
The toggle should activate, allowing users to enter Design Mode directly for the module.

**Actual Behavior:**  
- The "Design Mode" toggle is disabled (grayed out or visually unclickable).
- It remains in an off state.
- Users cannot proceed through this method.

---

### **Root Cause Analysis**
Based on user reports and testing, it appears that:
1. **Client-Side Limitation:** LiteCode's page rendering relies heavily on server-side logic. 
Attempts to force-enable Design Mode via client-side JavaScript fail because the toggle is 
disabled at render time.
2. **Indirect Activation Process:**  
   The intended method for enabling design mode requires users to:
   - Go to the "Manage" section of their account or project.
   - Locate the specific module in a list (e.g., under "Follow Me").
   - Generate a QR code associated with the module.
   
   After completing these steps, Design Mode may only become available through an undefined 
mechanism. This creates ambiguity about how and when design mode is actually enabled.

---

### **Technical Implications**
- The current implementation introduces unnecessary friction for users who want to customize 
modules directly.
- Server-side rendering prevents real-time client-side toggling of design mode via JavaScript, 
limiting user autonomy during module editing sessions.
- QR code generation ("Follow Me") seems misaligned with the purpose of enabling Design Mode 
unless it is part of a broader authentication or session management feature.

---

### **Suggested Solution**
1. **Direct Toggle for Each Module:**  
   Enable the "Design Mode" toggle directly within each foldout block to provide immediate user 
control.
   
2. **Clarify Activation Workflow (if QR code method remains):**  
   If Design Mode requires an additional step, ensure users are clearly informed of this 
requirement and avoid confusing them with unrelated processes like QR code generation.

3. **Client-Side Override:**  
   Investigate server-side limitations to allow client-side activation of design mode via 
JavaScript hooks or API endpoints (if applicable).

---

### **Priority**
**High Priority** â€“ This issue impacts core functionality, such as module customization and 
debugging. Users may become frustrated if they cannot directly enable Design Mode.

---

### **Affected Components**
- Module foldout interfaces.
- "Design Mode" toggle button within modules.
- Potential ties to server-side rendering logic or account management features ("Follow Me").

---

### **Recommendations**
1. Add explicit instructions in the LiteCode documentation for users encountering this issue.
2. Conduct a review of the Design Mode activation process to ensure it aligns with user 
expectations.
3. Evaluate whether QR code generation is part of the standard design mode workflow or an 
unrelated feature.
